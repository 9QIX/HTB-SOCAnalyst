# Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)

In the realm of effective threat detection and incident response, we often find ourselves relying on the limited log data at our disposal. However, this approach falls short of fully harnessing the immense wealth of information that can be derived from the powerful resource known as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). Unfortunately, this oversight can be attributed to a lack of awareness and appreciation for the comprehensive and intricate insights that ETW can offer.

## What is ETW?

According to Microsoft, Event Tracing For Windows (ETW) is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

ETW, functioning as a high-performance event tracing mechanism deeply embedded within the Windows operating system, presents an unparalleled opportunity to bolster our defense capabilities. Its architecture facilitates the dynamic generation, collection, and analysis of various events occurring within the system, resulting in the creation of intricate, real-time logs that encompass a wide spectrum of activities.

By effectively leveraging ETW, we can tap into an expansive array of telemetry sources that surpass the limitations imposed by traditional log data. ETW captures a diverse set of events, spanning system calls, process creation and termination, network activity, file and registry modifications, and numerous other dimensions. These events collectively weave a detailed tapestry of system activity, furnishing invaluable context for the identification of anomalous behavior, discovery of potential security incidents, and facilitation of forensic investigations.

ETW's versatility and extensibility are further accentuated by its seamless integration with Event Providers. These specialized components generate specific types of events and can be seamlessly incorporated into applications, operating system components, or third-party software. Consequently, this integration ensures a broad coverage of potential event sources. Furthermore, ETW's extensibility enables the creation of custom providers tailored to address specific organizational requirements, thereby fostering a targeted and focused approach to logging and monitoring.

Notably, ETW's lightweight nature and minimal performance impact render it an optimal telemetry solution for real-time monitoring and continuous security assessment. By selectively enabling and configuring relevant event providers, we can finely adjust the scope of data collection to align with our specific security objectives, striking a harmonious balance between the richness of information and system performance considerations.

Moreover, the existence of robust tooling and utilities, including Microsoft's Message Analyzer and PowerShell's Get-WinEvent cmdlet, greatly simplifies the retrieval, parsing, and analysis of ETW logs. These tools offer advanced filtering capabilities, event correlation mechanisms, and real-time monitoring features, empowering members of the blue team to extract actionable insights from the vast pool of information captured by ETW.

## ETW Architecture & Components

The underlying architecture and the key components of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) are illustrated in the following diagram from Microsoft.

![ETW Architecture](image.jpg)

### Controllers

The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace. Trace sessions can establish subscriptions to one or multiple providers, thereby granting the providers the ability to commence logging operations. An example of a widely used controller is the built-in utility "logman.exe," which facilitates the management of ETW activities.

At the core of ETW's architecture is the publish-subscribe model. This model involves two primary components:

### Providers

Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.

- **MOF Providers**: These providers are based on Managed Object Format (MOF) and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios.
- **WPP Providers**: Standing for "Windows Software Trace Preprocessor," WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
- **Manifest-based Providers**: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic event generation and customization.
- **TraceLogging Providers**: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code overhead.

### Consumers

Consumers subscribe to specific events of interest and receive those events for further processing or analysis. By default, the events are typically directed to an .ETL (Event Trace Log) file for handling. However, an alternative consumer scenario involves leveraging the capabilities of the Windows API to process and consume the events.

### Channels

To facilitate efficient event collection and consumption, ETW relies on event channels. Event channels act as logical containers for organizing and filtering events based on their characteristics and importance. ETW supports multiple channels, each with its own defined purpose and audience. Event consumers can selectively subscribe to specific channels to receive relevant events for their respective use cases.

### ETL files

ETW provides specialized support for writing events to disk through the use of event trace log files, commonly referred to as "ETL files." These files serve as durable storage for events, enabling offline analysis, long-term archiving, and forensic investigations. ETW allows for seamless rotation and management of ETL files to ensure efficient storage utilization.

#### Notes:

- ETW supports event providers in both kernel mode and user mode.
- Some event providers generate a significant volume of events, which can potentially overwhelm the system resources if they are constantly active. As a result, to prevent unnecessary resource consumption, these providers are typically disabled by default and are only enabled when a tracing session specifically requests their activation.
- In addition to its inherent capabilities, ETW can be extended through custom event providers.
- Only ETW provider events that have a Channel property applied to them can be consumed by the event log

## Interacting With ETW

Logman is a pre-installed utility for managing Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and Event Tracing Sessions. This tool is invaluable for creating, initiating, halting, and investigating tracing sessions. This is particularly useful when determining which sessions are set for data collection or when initiating your own data collection.

Employing the -ets parameter will allow for a direct investigation of the event tracing sessions, providing insights into system-wide tracing sessions. As an example, the Sysmon Event Tracing Sessions can be found towards the end of the displayed information.

```pwsh
C:\Tools> logman.exe query -ets

When we examine an Event Tracing Session directly, we uncover specific session details including the Name, Max Log Size, Log Location, and the subscribed providers. This information is invaluable for incident responders. Discovering a session that records providers relevant to your interests may provide crucial logs for an investigation.

Please note that the "-ets" parameter is vital to the command. Without it, Logman will not identify the Event Tracing Session.

For each provider subscribed to the session, we can acquire critical data:

Name / Provider GUID: This is the exclusive identifier for the provider.
Level: This describes the event level, indicating if it's filtering for warning, informational, critical, or all events.
Keywords Any: Keywords create a filter based on the kind of event generated by the provider.
